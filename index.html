                    <p>As you can see at the top of the page, my name is Kristen. I am looking to change my career, and my life! I received a B.A. in Studio Art but ended up in the insurance field--not even remotely my passion. After many years, I decided to pursue other avenues. I started my own business with my mom, making embroidered and engraved gifts for others. Our business is called Make It Mine, and we have an Etsy shop. You can see it here: <a href="http://www.makeitmine.info" target="_blank">www.makeitmine.info</a>. I do love it, but I need to get back into the workforce full-time. I started to learn coding in 2012, and I'm now ready to pursue a web career. That's how I ended up here, at a coding bootcamp!</p>
                    <p>I love pets. I used to have 2 siberian huskies, Maple and Kai, and 2 bunnies, Frankie and Mr. Darcy. I now have a black cat named Felix. I plan to add a dog or two in the next year. Fun fact: at the age of 12, I helped our family dog give birth to a litter of puppies while my mom was at work! I even had to help pull one out!</p>
                    <p>I have lived in 5 states--Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Ohio. I am definitely interested in relocating after bootcamp. I have visited 3 countries--Canada, England, and the Netherlands. I hope to add many more countries to that list.</p>
